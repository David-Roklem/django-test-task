# Django-test-task
Test task for a trainee position

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
Python 3, Django 4, VK auth with python-social-auth library

### Installing
It's recommended to use poetry as a package manager. It also includes virtual environment functions, so instead of using such virtualenv management systems as venv or pipenv you can try poetry. For complete and full reference proceed: https://python-poetry.org/docs/.

Once you've created a directory for the project and downloaded poetry use `poetry install` command to install all the needed dependecies

## Makefile
For your convenience, use "make name-of-command". E.g. command "make runserver" will execute "poetry run python manage.py runserver" (in more common case - "python manage.py runserver"). All the make commands are listed in django-test-task/my_django_project/Makefile.
